# Quantum Layer (Schrödinger, Ω-Collapse, Paradox Packs)

This directory contains all quantum-level demonstrations and bridges, including:

## Components

### • Spectral Schrödinger Engine  
High-precision spectral evolution, unitary norms, energy stability, and designed fail-cases for wrong-phase and diffusion operators.

### • Quantum Paradox Pack  
Double-slit interference, lawful Ω-collapse (Fejér-Ω), illegal projection tests, HF-energy blow-up controls, and UFET legality gates.

### • Ω-Collapse Operator  
A lawful finite-dimensional collapse engine respecting:
- mass preservation  
- HF energy monotonicity (H-law)  
- DC invariance  
- positivity & contractivity  

### • Quantum ↔ Standard Model Bridge  
Refinement-based harmonic-oscillator → Φ-channel consistency checks and Q3 UFET convergence.

All quantum demos connect structurally back to the same MARI substrate and are used upstream of cosmology, GR, and the Standard Model derivations.
