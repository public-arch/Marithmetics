# General Relativity (GR) Layer

This directory contains all GR-derived engines and invariants:

## Included Components

### • One-Action Einstein Engine
Closed-form TT-gauge Einstein evolution using the One-Action principle.

### • GR TT Linearization & T³ Lattice Tests
Validation of linearized GR on compact manifolds.

### • GW TT Flux Invariants
Structural gravitational-wave flux ratios and TT energy extraction.

### • BH Collar Invariants (KUEC × Unruh)
Black-hole collar scaling, KUEC seam invariants, Unruh curvature relationships.

### • Quantum→GR Bridges
Scripts that connect quantum harmonic refinements to Einstein-tensor limits.

---

All GR behavior here is derived structurally from the same substrate used by
SCFP++, DRPT, Φ-laws, and the One-Action functional.
