# DOC Layer (Discrete–Continuous Bridge)

This directory contains all demos and audits related to the DOC framework:
Discrete–continuous operators, field transitions, and formal verification of
continuum limits.

## Included Components

### • DOC Substrate and Gauge Rosetta  
Cross-base and cross-domain translators validating the discrete → continuous
bridge with Fejér kernels, Ω operators, and SCFP++ invariants.

### • Referee Audit Scripts  
Formal diagnostic runs used for verification:
- DOC referee closeout audit
- Gauge Rosetta base tests
- Discrete curvature invariants

### • Continuum Bridge Demos  
Mapping Superset invariants and DRPT sequences into:
- Field evolutions  
- PDE approximations  
- Infinitesimal limit behaviors  

---

The DOC layer ensures mathematical rigor and bridges discrete substrates with
emergent classical and quantum behavior.
