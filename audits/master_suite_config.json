    "DEMO-64": [
      "Residue structure: DRPT cross-base examples.",

      "Quantum gravity flagship.",

  "interludes_after": {
    "DEMO-34": [
      "From here on, treat the suite as a constrained cascade: the bridge sets the frame.",
      "Next we expose the residue structure (DRPT) before moving into admissibility and the flagship blocks."
    ],
    "DEMO-64": [
      "One useful mental model: this is not 'a pattern in rows'. It is two-way structure (rows and columns co-constrain).",
      "Tiling/recurrence is the empirical symptom. Next: admissibility gates turn that structure into yes/no engineering checks."
    ],
    "DEMO-72": [
      "After admissibility, the rest of the suite reads differently: each flagship becomes a stress-test, not a free parameter hunt."
