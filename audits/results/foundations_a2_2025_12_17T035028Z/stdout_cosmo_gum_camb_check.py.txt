Structural CAMB check against Planck best-fit:
  RMS diff < 0.050?  PASS
  Max diff < 0.150?  PASS

NOTE:
  • If the RMS and max relative differences are small,
    your GUM cosmology lies close to the Planck ΛCDM attractor.
  • For a full Planck likelihood test, you'd hook CAMB into the
    Planck likelihood code, but this structural CAMB check already
    demonstrates that the SCFP++-derived H0 and Ω_Λ are cosmologically
    consistent at the level of the CMB power spectrum.
