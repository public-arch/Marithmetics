# Controller Layer (Ω, Fejér, One-Action, OATB)

This directory contains all PDE controllers, universal regulators, and One-Action
field engines.

## Included Components

### • Ω⁻¹ Universal Controller (ND → 3D)
A dimension-agnostic controller proving universality of HF-tail contraction
across wave and diffusion channels.

### • Fejér–Ω Heat Controllers (3D, 4D)
Mass-preserving, HF-monotone, One-Transfer and One-Budget compliant PDE engines.

### • Fejér–Ω NS-like Controller (4D Vector Field)
Turbulence-damping structural controller with incompressibility, KE drops,
and HF kinetic suppression.

### • One-Action Field Synthesizer
Unified derivation of wave-like, gauge-like, and scalar-like PDEs from a
single structural kernel.

### • OATB Master Demo
One-Kernel / All-Behavior architecture tying quantum → classical → PDE
dynamics through Fejér/Ω operators.

All controllers in this directory share the same MARI substrate structure and
support the GR, SM, and infinity bridges.
