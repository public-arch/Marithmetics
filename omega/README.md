# Ω Layer (Projector, Commutant, SM Architecture)

This directory contains all demos tied to the Ω-operator, its algebraic
structure, and its role in Standard Model emergence.

## Included Components

### • Ω Projector & Commutant Proof  
Finite-dimensional proof that:
- The commutant of the cyclic shift \(S\) is exactly the circulant algebra  
- The unique admissible projector onto the zero-frequency sector is  
  \(\Omega = \frac{1}{M}11^T\)  
- Fejér kernels are positive, contractive, and commute with Ω  

### • Ω → SM Architecture (Tier-C Certificate)  
Full cross-base, SCFP++, UFET, and Φ-law structural path to:
- \( α = 1/w_U \)  
- \( \sin^2 θ_W \) from Φ-laws  
- \( α_s \) from odd-factors of \( w_U - 1 \)  
- CKM, PMNS, RG flows, Yukawas, neutrino seesaw, vacuum energy  

### • Weak-Mixing φ-Laws  
Structural derivation of weak mixing from:
\( Θ(q_2) = \frac{φ(q_2)}{q_2} \)  
and  
\( (1 - 2^{-v_2(w_U - 1)}) \)

The Ω operator is a unifying mathematical object appearing in:
- collapse dynamics  
- PDE regulation  
- SM couplings  
- Superset → Field bridges  
- Unitary / contractive evolutions
