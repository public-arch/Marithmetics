# DEMO-78 — Midlift Protocol (Master Flagship)

## What this demo is 
DEMO-78 is a deterministic certificate demo that makes the **Midlift Protocol** explicit and auditable.

The hostile-referee question it addresses is:
> If we actually start from the 0R-substrate and the residue grammar, does the 1D number-line appear as a derived *lift*, and do we lose structure by treating 1 D as primitive?

**Not a physics fit. Not parameter tuning. No external inputs upstream.**

## Run

```bash
python demos/foundations/demo-78-midlift-protocol-master-flagship/demo.py
```


## AoR notes
