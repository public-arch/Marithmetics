# DEMO-75 – Prediction Ledger Master Flagship

## Purpose
A consolidated ledger of forward predictions produced by the kernel pipeline. This demo is intended to be reviewable and falsifiable.


## Run
```bash
python demos/foundations/demo-75-prediction-ledger-master-flagship/demo.py
```

## Outputs (typical)
- Neutrino absolute masses and derived observables
- PMNS + CP-phase proxies (as implemented)
- Dark-sector candidate quantities and strong-field deviation proxies (as implemented)

## What falsifies it
- Any printed FAIL
- Missing prediction sections
- Any claim that cannot be reproduced by rerunning the script
