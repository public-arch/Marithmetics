# DEMO-34 â€“ Î¨â†’â†‹MSM Master Flagship (v1)

## Purpose
A master flagship certificate connecting Î©-selection to an SM â€™likeâ€ overlay.

Key components:
- Tier-A1 joint-triple Î¨ certificate (finite-band), with necessity ablations
- Lane-local stress test showing lane-local locks fail by 100k
- Tier-C SM overlay (PDF only for Î”•% reporting)

## Run
```bash
python demos/bridge/demo-34-omega-sm-master-flagship-v1/demo.py
```

## What falsifies it
- Any printed FAIL gate
- Missing certificate sections
- Non-deterministic behavior across repeat runs (within stated tolerances)
