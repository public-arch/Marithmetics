# DEMO-76 – Primorial–Yukawa Master Flagship

## Purpose
Constructs a lawful primorial-driven Yukawa sensitivity and stability report with explicit gates and reproducible outputs.

## Run
```bash
python demos/sm/demo-76-primorial-yukawa-master-flagship/demo.py
```

## What falsifies it
- Any printed FAIL
- Missing gate tables or missing stability summaries
- Non-deterministic behavior across repeat runs
