# Marithmetics — Unified Substrate for Physics, Mathematics, and Emergence

This repository contains the complete research architecture for **Marithmetics**,  
a first-principles framework unifying:

- Discrete substrates (DRPT, SCFP++)
- Cross-base invariants (Rosetta Hats, Φ-laws)
- Ω-operators & Fejér kernels
- One-Action and DOC bridges
- Infinity shells & regulators
- Standard Model derivation (DEMO-33)
- Cosmology (BB-36)
- GR invariants and KUEC seams
- Quantum paradox engines
- Universal PDE controllers (Ω⁻¹, OATB)

## Purpose

This repository is structured to support:

- **Full reproducibility** of all major demonstrations  
- **Cross-domain integration** from integers → invariants → fields → physics  
- **Formal verification** of structural laws  
- **Modular expansion** into Atlas, controllers, Ω-architecture, and emergence layers  

Marithmetics provides a unified substrate connecting number theory, physics,  
and emergence through shared structural invariants.
