# Marithmetics Publication Spine

Welcome. This folder contains the **canonical paper set** for the Marithmetics program.

Marithmetics is intentionally **audit-first**. The program is large and unorthodox, and it is designed to be adversarial to the standard failure modes of integer-derived claims. If you are evaluating this work, **verify before you interpret**.

## Start here

### Path A: 15-minute hostile audit
Use this path to decide whether the work should remain “numerology by default”, or whether it has earned deeper attention.

1. Read **PH-0** in **`00 - Governance/``.
2. Verify **one invariance pass** (base-as-gauge).
3. Verify **one designed-fail must-fail**.
4. Verify **one legality separation* * (admissible vs illegal operators).
5. Verify **one teeth event** (counterfactual degradation).

If any of these are missing, stop.

### Path B: 60-minute first real read
Use this path to understand the stack and see the mechanism survive stress.

1. **PH-0** (audit standard).
2. **Deterministic Operator Calculus (DOC)** (operator legality baseline).
3. **GOV Omega** (why the selector is identifiable rather than chosen).
4. **PH-2** (constants slice as exact rationals plus integrity contract).
5. **PH-3** (cosmology closure plus spectrum-level bridges and teeth).
6. **PH-4** (explicit controller/observer layer, commutation, residual budgets).

### Path C: deep audit and reproduction
Use this path to rerun and verify logs, tables, artifacts, and hashes.

- Use the **AoR tag** cited in the paper you are reading.
- Use **`demo_index.csv`** to locate demos and their one-liner run commands.
- Use **r
