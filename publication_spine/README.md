# Marithmetics - Publication Spine

This directory contains the canonical paper set for the Marithmetics program.

Marithmetics is built under an explicit audit posture.
It assumes skepticism. It requires verification.
Interpretation comes last.

If you are evaluating this work, begin with the audit surface.
If the audit fails, stop.

## How to Approach This Program

### Path A - 15 Minute Hostile Audit

This path answers a single question:

Should this remain classified as numerology by default?

1. Read PH-0 - Audit Standard in 00 - Governance.
2. Confirm one base-as-gauge invariance pass.
3. Confirm one designed-fail must-fail.
4. Confirm one legality separation (admissible vs illegal operators).
5. Confirm one counterfactual teeth event (deterministic degradation under reduced budget).

If any of these are missing, the correct conclusion is rejection.

---

### Path B - 60 Minute Structural Read

If the audit posture holds, examine the architecture:

u. PH-0 - Evidence discipline and non-circularity.
2. Deterministic Operator Calculus (DOC) - Operator legality baseline.
3. GOV Omega - Selector governance and identifiability.
4. PH-2 - Constants layer (exact rational outputs plus integrity contract).
5. PH-3 - Cosmology closure with spectrum bridges and illegal controls.
6. PH-4 - Controller and observer layer with commutation and residual budgets.

This is not a narrative sequence. It is a constraint sequence.

### Path C - Deep Audit and Reproduction

Use the Authority-of-Record (AoR) tag cited in the paper.

Do not verify against main.

Use:
- demo_index.csv to locate execution surfaces.
- falsification_matrix.csv to identify required failures.
- run_reproducibility.csv to confirm determinism posture.

- constants_master.csv for canonical structural outputs.

If a cited artifact does not exist under the cited tag, the claim is invalid.

## What This Is

Marithmetics is a finite-substrate architecture governed by:

- Cross-base invariance
- Operator admissibility
- Designed-fail separation
- Deterministic replay
- Counterfactual teeth

Claims are either:
- Proved as finite theorems, or
- Bound to a sealed AoR execution bundle.

Narrative is not evidence.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a parameter fit to external datasets.
- Not a post-hoc selection system.
- Not a smoothing and tuning pipeline.
- Not a solver overlay disguised as theory.

External overlays are Tier E.
They are fenced. They do not influence selection or acceptance.

The GUM report is an index.
IT is not the authority surface.

## Canonical DOC Anchor

The canonical Deterministic Operator Calculus PDF is intentionally preserved at:

publication_spine/Deterministic Operator Calculus.pdf

Multiple papers cite this exact path.
It must remain stable.

## Release Principle

This repository is structured so that a skeptical reader can verify without trusting intent.

If a claim is real, it should survive:

- Invariance
- Falsifiers
- Legality separation
- Deterministic replay
- Teeth

If it does not, the correct outcome is rejection.
