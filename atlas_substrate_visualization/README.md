# Visual Atlas (Structural Plates, DRPT Surfaces, Cross-Base Maps)

This directory contains tools and scripts used to generate the visual Atlas of
Marithmetics. The Atlas provides:

- DRPT surfaces and structural plates  
- Superset signature visualizations  
- Cross-base pattern comparisons  
- Symmetry-based plots  
- Substrate curvature and field maps  

Although some earlier gallery scripts may be deprecated, this directory
remains the central location for visual and structural representations used
for publication-quality figures.

The goal of the Atlas layer is to provide:
- clarity  
- reproducibility  
- cross-domain visual unification
